I have tried different approaches to learn [Erlang][erlang].
My last attempt is to solve some of the challenges at [Project Euler][euler].

It is going pretty good, and I have solved a good part of the challenges. I am nowhere near solving them all. But I will try to get in a few more solutions every week. It is a good way to hone my skills, and to repeat some of the math that I have forgotten (but should not have forgotten).

My approach is normally brute-force, to try to get the right solution, and then read the post in the forum afterwards, to learn how I should have solved the problem.

I will also try out some of the distributed parts of Erlang to speed up the solving of the problems.

You can check out my attempts at [GitHub][sourcecode].
