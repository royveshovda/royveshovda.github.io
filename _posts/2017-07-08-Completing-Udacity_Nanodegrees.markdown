I am quite happy to announce that I completed the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (AIND) from Udacity yesterday. I chose to focus on Computer Vision as my concentration.

This makes it the second Nanodegree from Udacity I have completed this year. Earlier I finished Deep Learning Foundation Nanodegree (DLND).

I am currently also enrolled in Robotics Nanodegree (RobND), and earlier this year I finished Term 1 (of 3) for the Nanodgree for Self Driving Cars (CarND).

It has been a busy time for me, but I have learned a lot, I feel prepared for the next wave of artificial intelligence.
