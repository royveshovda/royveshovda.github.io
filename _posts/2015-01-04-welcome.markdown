Welcome!

This is going to be my blog.
I have recently picked ut AI again, and will write updates on how that turns out.
The theory so far is that Erlang is a really good candidate for neural networks.

I am reading an interresting book by Gene Sher called [Handbook of Neuroevolution Through Erlang][springer].
